\section{Introduction} 


\texttt{undate} is a python library for working with uncertain or partially known dates, with support for multiple calendars \cite{koeser_undate_2025}. It is "an ambitious in-progress effort to develop a pragmatic Python package for the computation and analysis of temporal information in humanistic and cultural data, with a particular emphasis on uncertain, incomplete or imprecise dates and with support for multiple calendaring systems and date formats" \cite{koeser_princeton_2025}. The software is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/dh-tech/undate-python/}. This project was originally started at a DHTech Hackathon \cite{koeser_join_2023}, and builds on experiences from other digital humanities projects.

For an in depth understanding of the context, goals, humanities and software development methodologies that inform the project, and a comparison with related software, refer to the software paper "Undate: humanistic dates for computation" \cite{koeser_princeton_2025}.


\subsection{How is \texttt{Undate} like \texttt{datetime.date} ?} \label{sec:intro_details}


Both can be initialized by specifying numeric values for year, month, and day. Both can be printed using the default serialization (ISO8601, or YYYY-MM-DD), and we can compare them.

\begin{minted}{python}
import datetime

from undate import Undate

year, month, day = 2000, 11, 7

# these are equivalent and we initialize them the same way
dt_november7 = datetime.date(year, month, day)
november7 = Undate(year, month, day)

assert november7 == dt_november
\end{minted}


\subsection{How is \texttt{Undate} \textit{not} like \texttt{datetime.date}?}

An \texttt{Undate} can be initialized with partial information.  \texttt{Undate} can also take an optional label, since sometimes it's useful to name a date.  It can be initialized with year and month, just year, or even month and day with no year.

\begin{minted}{python}
# November 2000
november = Undate(year, month, label="November 2000")
# Year 2000
year2k = Undate(year, label="Y2K")
# November 7 in an unknown year
november7_some_year = Undate(month=month, day=day, label="Some November 7")
november7.label = "November 7, 2000"

# sometimes names are important
easter1916 = Undate(1916, 4, 23, label="Easter 1916")
\end{minted}


If you try to do that with \texttt{datetime.date}, you get a
\texttt{TypeError} because all three fields are required.

\begin{minted}{python}
try:
    datetime.date(year, month)
except TypeError as err:
    print(err)

"function missing required argument 'day' (pos 3)"
\end{minted}


Each of these \texttt{Undate} objects can be printed out in a standard
format; the \texttt{Undate} class also tracks how precisely a date is
specified, and can calculate the duration.  If we iterate over the
example partially-known dates initialized in the code block above and print label, formatted date, precision, and duration in days, we get output like this (here and throughout, formatting added for readability):

\begin{minted}{python}
for example_date in [
    november,
    year2k,
    november7_some_year,
    november7,
    easter1916,
]:
print(f"""{example_date.label} {example_date}
- Date precision: {example_date.precision}
- Duration in days: {example_date.duration().days}""")
\end{minted}

\paragraph{November 2000} \texttt{2000-11}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Date precision: MONTH
    \item Duration in days: 30
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Y2K} \texttt{2000}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Date precision: YEAR
    \item Duration in days: 366
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Some November 7} \texttt{-}\texttt{-11-07}
\begin{itemize}
   \item  Date precision: DAY
   \item Duration in days: 1
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{November 7, 2000} \texttt{2000-11-07}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Date precision: DAY
    \item Duration in days: 1
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Easter 1916} \texttt{1916-04-23}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Date precision: DAY
    \item Duration in days: 1
\end{itemize}

We can also do some simple calculations, like checking whether one date falls within another date.
\begin{minted}{python}
assert november in year2k   # 2000-11 in 2000
assert november7 in november  # 2000-11-07 in 2000-11
assert easter1916 not in year2k  # 1916-02-23 not in 2000
assert november7_some_year not in year2k  # --11-07 not in 2000
\end{minted}

\section{What else can \texttt{Undate} do?}

\subsection{Partially known values}

In the last set of examples, the values used to initialize \texttt{Undate} instances were all integers and parts of the date were either known or unknown. But what if you know part of a
date?

You can initialize \texttt{Undate} with strings and use \texttt{X} to
indicate unknown values.  (We chose \texttt{X} based on the \href{https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/}{Extended Date Time Format (EDTF)} specification).

Here we initialize two dates with partially known information, where a year or month cannot be precisely pinned down but some information is known. As before, we can iterate over these dates
and output label, formatted date, precision, and duration:

\begin{minted}{python}
someyear_1900s = Undate("19XX", label="1900s")
late2022 = Undate(2022, "1X", label="late 2022")

for example_date in [someyear_1900s, late2022]:
    print(f"""{example_date.label} {example_date}
- Date precision: {example_date.precision}
- Duration in days: {max(example_date.duration().days)}
)
\end{minted}

\paragraph{1900s} \texttt{19XX}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Date precision: YEAR
    \item Duration in days: 366
\end{itemize}
    
\paragraph{late 2022} \texttt{2022-1X}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Date precision: MONTH
    \item Duration in days: 31
\end{itemize}    

    
If you try that with \texttt{datetime.date} you get another \texttt{TypeError}.    

\begin{minted}{python}
try:
    datetime.date("19XX", 1, 1)
except TypeError as err:
    print(err)

"'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer"
\end{minted}

\subsection{Uncertain durations}

If you were paying close attention, you may have noticed I used the
\texttt{max()} function in the code block above where I output the duration for the partially known dates.

The most recent version of \texttt{undate} (version 0.5) includes experimental support for 
uncertain time deltas.

\begin{minted}{python}
print(f"""{someyear_1900s.label} {someyear_1900s}
- duration: {someyear_1900s.duration()}
- duration in days: {someyear_1900s.duration().days}

{late2022.label} {late2022}
- duration: {late2022.duration()}
- duration in days: {late2022.duration().days}
"""
\end{minted}

\paragraph{1900s} \texttt{19XX}
\begin{itemize}
    \item duration: \texttt{UnDelta(days=[365,366])}
    \item duration in days: \texttt{UnInt(lower=365, upper=366)}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{late 2022} \texttt{2022-1X}
\begin{itemize}
    \item duration: \texttt{UnDelta(days=[30,31])}
    \item duration in days: \texttt{UnInt(lower=30, upper=31)}
\end{itemize}
    
    
Even without precise information, we can still do some useful comparisons. February of an unknown year is still shorter than October, November, or December.

\begin{minted}{python}
some_february = Undate(month=2, label="February of some year")
assert some_february.duration() < late2022.duration()

# February of an unknown year is shorter than 
# an uncertain month 1X (October, November, or December) 
some_february.duration() < late2022.duration() = True

assert some_february.duration() < late2022.duration()

print(f"""### {some_february.label} {some_february}
- duration: {some_february.duration()}
- duration in days: {some_february.duration().days}
""")

\end{minted}

\paragraph{February of some year} \texttt{-}{-02}
\begin{itemize}
    \item duration: \texttt{UnDelta(days=[28,29])}
    \item duration in days: \texttt{UnInt(lower=28, upper=29)}
\end{itemize}
    
\section{Example use cases from specific projects}\label{example-use-cases-from-specific-projects}


\textbf{TODO}: briefly describe here how undate generalizes work from projects and is informed by project-specific context, and we hope to keep that way in future (quote sw article?)

\subsection{Princeton Geniza Project}\label{princeton-geniza-project}

The \href{https://geniza.princeton.edu/}{\textit{Princeton Geniza Project}} (PGP) is
a long-running project focused on materials from a synagogue in Cairo; these contents are
primarily medieval, and largely written in Hebrew script. Because they are older and fragmentary, many of them cannot be dated;  those documents that do have dates use a variety of calendars — the Hebrew \textit{Anno Mundi} and Seleucid calendars, as well as the
Islamic \textit{Hijri} calendar. 

An \texttt{Undate} instance preserves any initial values for year, month, and day in the original calendar. As you see in Table \ref{tab:pgp-parsed-dates}, the ISO format \texttt{Undate} corresponds to the original date rather than the standardized date.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering 
  \begin{tabular}{rlllllll}
    \toprule

  \caption{A sampling of dates from PGP documents in different calendars; dates have been parsed by \texttt{Undate}, which was then used to report precision and weekday.}
  \label{tab:pgp-parsed-dates}
\end{table}

Under the hood, \texttt{undate} calculates the earliest and latest possible dates in range for comparison and sorting. When an \texttt{Undate} object is initialized with a different calendar, the earliest and latest dates are based on conversion to the Gregorian calendar so that dates can be compared and used together across calendars. (For the code used to parse PGP document dates displayed in this example, refer to Appendix \ref{appdx:parse-pgp-dates}). When working across calendars, dates with the same precision (year, month) often have different durations in days.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

%% should any of these be UnInt? might be a bug in undate...

An \texttt{Undate} object is aware of date precision, which means that in a dataset with mixed precision dates like PGP, once the dates are parsed we can easily see the variation (Table \ref{tab:pgp-parsed-dates}).\footnote{With the caveat that in this case the results are somewhat skewed by the dates we're able to parse; PGP data includes the modifiers not yet supported by \texttt{undate}, which were ignored during parsing.}

\begin{table}[h]

    \toprule

  \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

Preserving available details in mixed precision dates offers new opportunities for analysis; for instance, we can analyze weekday frequency by document type (Figure \ref{fig:pgp-weekday-frequency} ). In the PGP data, Legal documents and letters are the types of documents most likely to have a clear date. When visualized with a heatmap, the results match our expectations: Saturday is light for both types, because it is the Hebrew Shabbat, a day of rest. Monday and Thursday are the traditional convening days for court sessions, which is reflected in the preponderance of Legal documents on those days.

\subsection{Shakespeare and Company
Project}\label{shakespeare-and-company-project}

\href{https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/}{\textit{Shakespeare and Company
Project}} is based on the materials from Sylvia Beach's famous
English-language lending library which operated in Paris in the 1920s
and 1930s.

This project includes borrowing events with unknown years; with
\texttt{undate} we can calculate how long a book was borrowed even when
we don't know the exact year.

First we define a couple of methods that we'll use with the data; one to
parse the date and calculate duration in days, and another for an
indicator whether the year was known or not.


\begin{table}[h]
  \centering 
  \begin{tabular}{lllrllrrl}

\paragraph{Another tip.} In some cases, it may be helpful to use \texttt{paragraph} to title individual paragraphs. For example, if a section describes features for a classifier, you can optionally title each paragraph with the name of each feature. 

\section{Elements}

\subsection{Citing elements}

Here are some examples of how to construct and reference common elements in LaTeX. References to elements such as tables, figures, equations and sections make use of \texttt{label} names that you set. References to citations should use the labels you indicate in \texttt{bibliography.bib}. Change all of these examples and values with your own data. 

We can cite Table~\ref{tab:example} as well as Figure~\ref{fig:example}, and we also cite an example paper \cite{tettoni2024discoverability}.
We can also include mathematical notations, such as:
\begin{align}
f(y) &= x^2. \label{fig:squared}
\end{align}
The line number of the equation can be cited as
Equation~\ref{fig:squared}. You can also cite multiple papers together \cite{barré2024latent, levenson2024textual, bambaci2024steps}, and reference figures or tables indirectly in parentheses (Figure~\ref{fig:example_bigger}). You can also cite other sections or subsections of your paper, such as \S\ref{sec:intro_details}. 


\begin{table}[h]
  \centering 
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \toprule
    Column Name 1 & Column Name 2\\
    \midrule
    d1 & d2 \\
    d1 & d2 \\
    d1 & d2 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Example table and table caption.}
  \label{tab:example}
\end{table}


\subsection{Required specifications}

Tables and figures should \textit{not} appear at the top of the first page above the paper title and abstract, but can be placed within the main text, as exemplified by Table~\ref{tab:example}. They may also be placed at the top of non-first pages, as exemplified by Figures~\ref{fig:example} and \ref{fig:example_bigger}. Figures and tables discussed in the main text should appear \textit{before} the References section. Supplementary materials should be referenced by their relevant Appendix section, such as Appendix~\ref{appdx:first}. 

Do \textit{not} change the font size of table and figure captions, or the spacing between text lines, section/subsection titles, tables, figures, and captions. You should size your figures and tables so that they stay within the \texttt{linewidth} of the paper.

\section{Parsing PGP document dates in multiple calendars} \label{appdx:parse-pgp-dates}

Princeton Geniza Project data includes documents with original dates in multiple calendars.  \texttt{undate} does not yet provide an omnibus parser, so dates must be parsed according to their a known, supported calendar.  The dates in this dataset are complicated and messy, and include qualifiers and uncertainty not yet supported by \texttt{undat}e parsing. For demonstration purposes, this example code removes and ignores those complexities.

Adapted from an \href{https://github.com/dh-tech/undate-python/blob/main/examples/pgp_dates.ipynb}{example notebook} included in the \texttt{undate} software repository.
